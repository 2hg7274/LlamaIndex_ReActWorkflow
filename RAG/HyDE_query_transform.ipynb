This observation was further reinforced when Graham applied to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy, where he encountered a similar lack of structured education.

He worked at Aperture Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing photography as a fine art form, from 1988 to 1990. During his time there, he edited and published several books on photography. In 1990, Graham embarked on a series of photographic projects that would define his career. He traveled extensively, capturing the essence of different cultures and landscapes through his lens. His first major project was \"A1,\" a black-and-white series documenting the M25 motorway around London. This work showcased his unique approach to street photography and laid the foundation for his future projects. Throughout the 1990s, Graham continued to produce thought-provoking and critically acclaimed works, such as \"Beyond the Pale\" and \"Protestantism.\" These projects further solidified his reputation as one of the most innovative photographers of his generation. In addition to his photographic pursuits, Graham also began writing essays about photography and its role in society, contributing to various publications and curating exhibitions. His work has been exhibited in numerous galleries and museums worldwide, and he continues to be a prominent figure in the contemporary photography landscape.\\n\"\"\"'"

Inspired by John McCarthy's original Lisp, Bel aims to be a complete programming language based on McCarthy's axiomatic approach, where each modification is a \"discoveredness-preserving transformation.\" The language was written in itself within the Arc programming language, employing various hacks to achieve self-interpreting capabilities. The development process was challenging due to the intricate nature of creating an interpreter written in itself, leading to difficulties in understanding and debugging the code. Graham dedicated significant effort to Bel, even prioritizing its completion over writing essays, and found the experience both difficult and rewarding. He recalls moments of intense focus and satisfaction, including solving complex problems while spending time with his children. The majority of Bel's development occurred in England, where the Graham family moved temporarily to provide their children with international experiences. After four years of intensive work, Bel was finally completed in the fall of 2019."

He notes that programs written today will likely be obsolete within a couple of decades. Even if they were highly regarded in their time, they would seem feeble and outdated to future generations. The author mentions that systems work doesn't last, and uses the example of surplus Xerox Dandelions that were once cutting-edge but are now considered slow and impractical by current standards.

Furthermore, he appreciates the potential for artistic independence, where artists don't have bosses or rely on external funding, allowing for greater freedom and creativity. The author's newfound passion for art is highlighted by his decision to take art classes at Harvard during his PhD program in computer science, despite knowing that it might complicate his academic career. He describes the idea of making art as almost miraculous, emphasizing his curiosity and fascination with the process of creating art. He likens painting still lives to closely observing the world, noticing details that are usually overlooked in everyday life. This deep engagement with the subject matter allows for a more nuanced and realistic portrayal, even surpassing photographic accuracy in some ways. His interest in art stems from a desire to understand and capture what he sees, rather than just replicating it superficially.\n",

Despite the challenges, the author remains dedicated to both pursuits, finding inspiration and fulfillment in each. Ultimately, he values the enduring nature and creative independence of art more than the transient nature of engineering, but he also recognizes the excitement and intellectual challenge that engineering provides. This duality reflects the multifaceted nature of his identity and his ongoing quest to balance his professional and artistic aspirations.</b>"
